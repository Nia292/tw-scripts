This is the path to the Savage Wilds. Before you go on, be aware that some gear might not survive the travelling.

Be sure to not bring any Ravencrest notes or books written on! as the ink will not survive the transfer and be lost to the void! 

Once you have passed though, be patient until you have fully manifested.

(At first transfer, you'll get into character creation. Go over it and then relog to *Savage Wilds server*, if it does not reload automatically. If you end up naked after transfer, try to relog - on fail open a support ticket on discord)

(Thralls, pets and horses won't follow!)

(DLC items, when you don't own the DLC and any battlepass or challenge items may get lost!!)

(Written notes and journals from Ravencrest may get deleted!!!)

(Selected traits from attribute tree will be inactive until relog or death on the other side)

(Currently you may have to resize, if you do not get warped!)
