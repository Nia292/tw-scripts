The fabled craftsmen. Let me see, if I can remember them all.

  The blacksmiths! Ivarr, he resides in the north, around and in Asgarath. Alfhild. Some claim, they've seen her at the Black Galleon.
  The armorers. Ha. Berglind always roams around the Mounds and in the little camps. Some say, she comes south to the Den sometimes. Thorunn and Talaan..they talk a lot with the pirates of the black hand. Might be a good lead to try around the Black Galleon.
  The Alchemists. Gabriela, she often is in Asgarath or at the Wardtowers. Some claim, they have seen the gemcutter at the wardtowers as well. But Serpa mostly is seen in Sepermeru.
  Landora..groomer. Ha. She's with the Lemurians in the jungle. Katla, the smelter - she can be encountered at the northern camps or at Asgarath.
  Floki. He seems to like the same spots as Beast the Breaker. Try down at the river, west of the sandswept ruins.
  The other taskmasters. Julia can be found among the Darfari at spinebreaker. *LADY* - he snorts - Elizabeth Killigrew, they say she is at the Volcano. But I've seen her lurking at the den as well. Viek - he barely leaves Sepermeru. Akasuki - that one enjoys company of the northern tribes around Asgarath, much like Fass.
  And hm..oh yes. The carpenter. Hekla. She hides at the Mounds.
  I think, that's all of them, I remember.","B":"Uh. A lot.
