Hm.... I see a curious being, covered in sand and rags. Some would call him a maniac who's lost his wits from the ever-ravaging harsh winds of the desert dunes. Others, more... \"spiritually inclined\" let's say, would perhaps call him wise or enlightened even. Seek him, and maybe, just maybe, you shall find your fortune. ","B":"Okay.

Hm. I see a garden, in the midst of a lush, green jungle. Black lotuses grow all over the area. It is at the trunk of a great, old tree that you shall find your treasure.

Oh, adventurer... I see danger ahead of you, and possibly even death. Sweltering heat, a rotting corruption... aj aj aj. What you desire lies amidst ruins of a city once great, but now long forgotten and left to the unforgiving sands. Undead souls and gargantuous beasts of both claw and flame roam the lands.

Oh... Interesting. The fortune you seek lies in a city of relic hunters. More specifically, in the quarters of a great woman of Shem. However, the crystal ball tells me she was possessed by an evil entity. If she still is, or if she has ridden herself of the curse, I do not know. Seek her out, and you shall find your treasure.

Hmm.... The treasure you seek will take you on a dangerous path up north. I see a great magnificent bridge, named after a deceit. It crosses the frozen waters below, and it is down there, at the northernmost pillar, that you will find your fortune. But perhaps bring a warm coat so you don't catch a cold!
